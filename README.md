## DapooBot
An attempt to create my own Discord Bot

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7.5 or higher
2. Discord.py

## Setup
If you really want to try the bot, you will need to create a file specifically to store your token named:
> heartBot.py

Then add the following code:
```py
token = "Your Discord Bot Token Here"
```

That's it! You are all set.
More changes coming soon as I am still in learning phase.
