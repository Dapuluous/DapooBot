## DapooBot
An attempt to create my own Discord Bot

## Setup
If you really want to try the bot, you will need to create a file specifically to store your token named
> heartBot.py\

Then you will need to add the following code
```
token = "Your Discord Bot Token Here"
```

That's it! You are all set.
More changes coming soon as I am still in learning phase.
